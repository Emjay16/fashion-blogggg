                <h2>TAKING A PAUSE FROM GWC</h2>
                <img src="Screen-Shot-2023-10-18-at-5.webp" alt="">
                <p>It’s been over a year since my last blog post, which is the longest I’ve gone without posting, Ever. It’s crazy to think this blog used to publish content almost every day of the week during the heyday of blogs!

                    With the workload and success of Girl With Curves collection over the past two years, a gnarly car accident, and the loss of a family member, I needed some time away from this space to focus on my mental health. In the midst of brainstorming all the ways I was going to come back to this space stronger than ever, I’ve developed a craving for something fresh and new – a place where I can continue sharing all the things I’m passionate about, without the clutter of social media’s algorithm, or having to upload to a website; a place where I can truly build a community outside of a comment section, where discussions can dive deeper than ever before, adding the type of value I personally seek in my own day-to-day life.</p>

                    <h2>THIS SUNDRESS IS A MUST-HAVE FOR SUMMER</h2>
                    <img src="52208707137_b2f7d258f4_k.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>I’m a big fan of sundresses, but most of the time the straps aren’t wide enough to cover my bra strap, and I’m not a fan of strapless bras. Enter this ruffle strap sundress, with ruffle straps wide enough to cover any type of bra strap!

                        This sundress is a lightweight chiffon fabric with a knit lining and elastic at the waistline for waist shape. It’s a classic midi length, available in petite and regular lengths, and of course it has GWC signature pockets. It’s available in this polka dot print as well as a statement red-orange solid, in sizes XXS-5X.</p>

                        <p>For years I’ve wanted to create a dress that embodied the look of a skirt and a top, and it’s finally here!
                            The Twofer Midi Dress has a knit top and woven satin bottom with elastic at the waistline for waist shape. It’s a classic midi length, available in petite and regular lengths, and of course it has GWC signature pockets. It’s available in 3 color ways, sizes XXS-5X.</p>

                            <p>It wouldn’t be a GWC Collection without a statement, pleated trench, would it?!

                                The Pleated Trench is back with a few chic updates, including a collar, covered-fabric buttons and more, in Navy and Black. It can be worn as a trench coat, or fully buttoned down the front as a dress. The fabric is a knit so it’s super comfy with lots of stretch. 
                                
                                Shop it here in sizes XXS-5X.</p>
